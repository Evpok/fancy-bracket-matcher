[2.1.0]: https://github.com/Evpok/fancy-bracket-matcher/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0
### Changed
  - Highlight colour is now set to `@syntax-color-modified` which by default is the original orange. We thus come back to our former look while still allowing syntax themes to override it to a more suitable colour.
  - Brought back a more exploding effect to the animation.
