CHANGELOG
=========

## **1.0.1**
  - **BREAKING ** Fix [issue #3](https://github.com/Evpok/fancy-bracket-matcher/issues/3) by removing shadow selectors, thanks to [Michael van Olden](https://github.com/emveeoh). This probably break compatibility with [Atom < 1.13](http://blog.atom.io/2016/11/14/removing-shadow-dom-boundary-from-text-editor-elements.html).
  - This package seems stable, globally unharmful and (oddly enough) useful to people other than me. So hey, let's make this breaking release our first major release! :tada:
